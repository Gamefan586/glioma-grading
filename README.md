# Glioma Grading with Soft-Voting Ensemble Models

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive tumors with an extremely low five-year survival rate of about 7%. It is the highest stage of glioma, a type of tumor that arises in the brain or spinal cord, and is also highly invasive. As a result, it is crucial to accurately and quickly classify whether a brain tumor is a low-grade glioma or GBM. However, due to GBMâ€™s intracranial location, biopsies can sometimes damage surrounding brain tissue. Another option, MRIs, are primarily used to determine the size and location of a tumor and cannot reliably differentiate between low-grade gliomas (grades 1 and 2) and GBM (grade 4). By using genetic and omics biomarkers to grade gliomas, this project aims to improve traditional diagnosis and treatment options.
